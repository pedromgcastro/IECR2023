# IECR2023
Code for of the global optimization algorithm featured in the article submitted to Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. in June 2023.
"Global Optimization of QCPs using MIP relaxations with a base-2 logarithmic partitioning scheme".
There are 3 folders, one containing the GAMS code and instances for the WUN design problem, and two for the GAMS code and instances for the pooling problem.
The folders for the pooling problem are divided in the q- and tp-formulations. Data files for instances A0-A9 can be found in tp-formulation folder.
